# Falke

_not production ready!!!_

Falke, German for "falcon", is a Rust implementation of the Fast-Fourier Lattice-based Compact Signatures over NTRU cryptographic algorithm.

It is an almost one-to-one implemntation of the reference implementation submitted to the NIST Post-Quantom Project on November 30th, 2017 as it can be found on [falcon-sign.info](https://falcon-sign.info/). 

I made this as a crypto-rust-learning project, but even if I was more versed in the matter, I would advise to only use it for proof of concepts as the algorithm has just been published and not been widely checked yet.
