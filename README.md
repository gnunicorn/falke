# Falke

_not production ready!!!_

Falke, German for "falcon", is a Rust implementation of the Fast-Fourier Lattice-based Compact Signatures over NTRU cryptographic algorithm.

It is an almost one-to-one implemntation of the reference implementation submitted to the NIST Post-Quantom Project on November 30th, 2017 as it can be found on [falcon-sign.info](https://falcon-sign.info/). 

I made this as a crypto-rust-learning project, but even if I was more versed in the matter, I would advise to only use it for proof of concepts as the algorithm has just been published and not been widely checked yet.

For more about the algorithm itself, please go to [falcon-sign.info](https://falcon-sign.info/)
